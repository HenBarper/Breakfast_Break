## Room for Seconds:

While Breakfast Break is delectable as-is, there's always room for improvement:

- Difficulty Scaling: Currently, the difficulty remains consistent throughout the game. Our next course of action is to implement a system that increases the challenge as players progress, keeping things exciting.
- Visual Polish: We plan to add more animations and sound effects to further enhance the breakfasty atmosphere and create a truly immersive experience.
- Leaderboards and Achievements: Who wouldn't want to brag about their breakfast mastery? Adding leaderboards and achievements will add a layer of friendly competition and motivate players to keep coming back for more.

## Meet the Devs

   This game is the delicious result of a two-week project by Ben Harper, Sarah Markland, & Mike Bilbee, full-stack students & friends at Atlas School in Tulsa, OK! We put our second trimester OOP skills to the test with a surprise breakfast theme, and this is what we whipped up.

   While the entire project was a fun learning experience, one challenge stood out: adapting the GDScript3 tutorials to the newer GDScript4. Function syntax changes and missing features required us to think critically and experiment to find solutions. Through perseverance and collaborative problem-solving, we deciphered the differences and successfully translated the core mechanics.

   We wanted to work with more of our cohort than the limit of 3 people per group, so we came up with the idea to link multiple projects together at the [BreakfastHub](https://breakfasthub.itch.io/). Please visit the Breakfast Hub to see Breakfast Break along with two other games developed by our peers.

   We had a blast creating this project, and we hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!
